/*   This file provides interfaces of a malloc for manging registered RDMA regions.
     It shall be linked to the dedicated ssmalloc library which can be installed
     by following instructions in ../ralloc/README.md.

     Usage:
     To manage allocation in RDMA registered region, just pass the start pointer and the
     size to RInit() for initlization.
     Before Each thread can alloc memory, they shall call RThreadLocalInit() at first.

     Rmalloc and Rfree works as the same as standard malloc and free. The addresses returned
     is in the registered memory region.

     Limitation:
     We assume there is exactly one RDMA region on one machine.  Which is enough most of the time.
